Cancer Detection system using AI

'x' attributte is going to be our dataset and 'y' attribute is going to be if the tumor is malignant-cancerous(1) or benign-noncancerous(0)

I use 'neural network' to check if a cell is  malignant-cancerous(1) or benign-noncancerous(0)

so to conculde our machine learning algorithm can correctly classify the cancerous tumors with '0.9473' accuracy or 94% accuracy.
